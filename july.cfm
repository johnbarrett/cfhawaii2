										<h1>CF Scheduled Tasks: more than you may know, and should</h1>
									</header>

								<p>
                  If folks were asked to discuss CF scheduled tasks, I suspect most would feel "there's not much 'to say", but there really is a lot more to working with them simply "setting a given url to run on a given schedule" (did you know it could be a CFC, for instance?).

               </p>

               <p>
                There are both more features than most realize, as well as solutions to common problems people can face when running them, and a lot of myths regarding old limitations that have since been lifted. In this talk, veteran CF troubleshooter Charlie Arehart will address all these and more, starting with a focus on tools and techniques for solving common problems with them, then showing several ways to create them (yes, even more than just cfschedule and the CF Admin UI).
               </p>

                <p>
                He'll also discuss briefly the underlying quartz open source framework that powers them (and offers still more extensibility), as well as the underlying neo-cron.xml file and tips for protecting that, and he'll even identify ways to control/allow access to managing tasks that may surprise many. He'll conclude with alternatives when the base features don't suit you.
               </p>

              
                <p>
                So yeah, a lot more to the topic than most might imagine! As always, Charlie will provide links to resources with more info (docs, videos, and more).
               </p>
