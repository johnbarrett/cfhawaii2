# Intoduction to OOP with CFML

**Please note:**
- This is just a "getting started" presentation. It is necessarily incomplete, there are endless resouces out there about OOP.
- Only some basics are covered, not the advanced uses
- The goal of this presentation is to get you a basic understanding of object orientation and to show you a simple way to implement it in your application
- Some examples are only meant to illustrate a point, they are not best practices (sometimes they can not even be considered “good code”)
- Syntax is shown in the code samples and (almost) never in the slides
- The code samples do not provide explanations about the theory behind it
